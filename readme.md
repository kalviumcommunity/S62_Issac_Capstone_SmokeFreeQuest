# Smoke Free Quest

Smoke Free Quest is a motivational platform that helps individuals quit smoking by transforming the journey into an engaging and rewarding experience. Rather than simply tracking smoke-free days, it turns quitting into a game-like adventure, where users progress, unlock rewards, and stay motivated by remaining smoke-free.

## How It Works:

1. Each day a user goes without smoking, their counter increases.
At key milestones—50, 100, 150, and 200 days—users unlock rewards, including badges and characters.
2. These rewards serve as motivation, making the journey more exciting and reinforcing positive behavior.

By celebrating progress in a fun and interactive way, Smoke Free Quest keeps users motivated and committed to a healthier, smoke-free life.

## Key Features:

1. Login/Sign page
2. Characters and badges designed using blendr
3. Unlock new characters and badges at 50, 100, 150, and 200 days.
4. Displays progress, upcoming rewards, and motivational stats
5. Tracks each smoke-free day and updates progress automatically.
